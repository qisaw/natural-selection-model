# Contributing to NaturalSelectionModel
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
1. Ensure the test suite passes. `npm run test`
1. Make sure your code lints. `npm run lint`
1. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](./LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/qisaw/natural-selection-model/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

Use the following templates to report new issues and bugs:
* [Bug reports](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
* [Feature request](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code styling. Please ensure your code follows the following style guidelines

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Semi-colons
* Trailing commas
* Quote strings with single quotes
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
* You can run `npm run format` for auto formatting

## Commits
Understandable commits are really important. It's important that each commit in your pull request:
* Is a small, understandable chunk.
* Tells a story of how the feature is implemented and should be reviewed.
* Should have a commit message which explains what the commit is about.
* Should have an explaining commit comment if the commit message needs more context.
* Should have an issue number assigned in the commit message if possible in the format `Issue #{issue_number}: {message}`
