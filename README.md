![](https://github.com/qisaw/natural-selection-model/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

**Note that this repository is currently a work in progress. The end goal of this is to create a package where by users may configure different parameters of a natural selection model and get the results.**

This repository tries to model natural selection. It runs simulations of multiple players on a single board moving around.

`@TODO add rules and more documentation on how to use.`
